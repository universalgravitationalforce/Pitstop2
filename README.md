For the short story, I choose *Eveline* from James Joyce's *Dubliners*(page 42 - 48).

I used the built-in automatical OCR of apple to scan the texts of *Dubliners* from safari in my tablet.
Then I sent the texts to my computer by email.
Then I created a .txt document and cleaned the text manually in my computer.

From the qualitative and quantitative analysis, I've learned that the quantitative analysis is able to provide accurate information summarizing the main contents of the story. But the analysis of theme might not be able to dive deeper. For instance, there's no clear evidence shown that generational trauma between Eveline herself and her mother. Besides, quantitative analysis is not able to distinguish the narrator of the story, either homodiegetic or heterodiegetic.
However, I find that quantitative analysis is able to piece together all the fragmented clues within a scene thanks to the *Links* visualisation tool. For instance, all the clues about "home" in this short story.
